***** This is the File Managment System ********
It is implemented using c++ language. I used Vectors and linked list to store/save and retrieve data.
It did not create any file on the disk. It is just a virtual explanation of how the files are managed by the Operating System




*******How to run *******

Just simple download all 3 files (fileMang.cpp, fileMang.h, main.cpp) then build and compile all these files
It is command line based and easy to follow


******* Problems ********

--> Right now it only works till the program ends. Once,it ends all the data will be deleted.
